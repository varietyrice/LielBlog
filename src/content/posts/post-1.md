It was a beautiful Friday evening, I just packed my bags and took off from my work. Just as I was crossing the park, I saw him coming towards me talking with someone over his phone. At that moment, I got startled and didn't know what to do with my mind cluttered with work stuff. I just took my iPad to correct my hair. Whilst all this turmoil in my mind, I was unaware that he was looking at me all along. He then was smiling at his phone, when I went closer to check it out, it was this picture, that he was smiling at.
